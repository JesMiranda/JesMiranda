- 👋 Hello, future programmer! Welcome to my GitHub!
- ✨ Here, I’m @JesMiranda
- 👩🏻‍🎓 Am also at the beginning of my Computer Science journey, so I know what it's like to be in the 1st semester, full of curiosity, but maybe a little lost.
- ✍🏼 This space is a digital diary of my learning.
- 👩🏻‍💻 I'm building projects from scratch, just like you.
- 💻If something doesn't make sense right now, don't worry – we're here to learn together.
- 💫Let's explore the incredible world of programming and make the 1st semester the beginning of something great!
